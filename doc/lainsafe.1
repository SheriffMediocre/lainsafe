.SH NAME
lainsafe \- Simple file upload

.SH DESCRIPTION

lainsafe is a simple file upload server written in Perl + CGI.

It runs in a Web server (i.e. nginx) with a CGI handler
(i.e. fcgiwrap)

.SH INSTALLATION

You can use any web server for running lainsafe. However, nginx is
recommended. The following configuration should work for nginx:

.I /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/lainsafe.conf
.in +4n
.EX
server
{
	server_name lainsafe.foo.tld;

	listen 80;
	listen [::]:80;
	client_max_body_size 100m; # max size 100MBs, change 10 to 100
				   # in upload.cgi in line 30
	root /var/www/lainsafe;

	location ~ \.cgi$ {
		gzip off;
		include /etc/nginx/fastcgi_params;
		fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/fcgiwrap.socket;
		fastcgi_index index.cgi;
		fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME /var/www/lainsafe/$fastcgi_script_name;
	}
}
.EE

The document root will be /var/www/lainsafe (be sure to change it in
.I root
and
.I fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME if you're going to use another directory
